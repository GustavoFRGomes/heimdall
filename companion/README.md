# Heimdall Companion Application

This is the directory where the source code and additional resources will be,
the application itself will be executing the Restful API presented by the
Heimdall system executing on the Raspberry Pi.

The communication between the server and client apps will need to be secure and
a process of authentication needs to be done and a token generated for that
particular companion app on the device. There would be a key that is sent to
the device/client in order to make the entire thing work.
