% A conclusão deste trabalho, bem como da grande maior parte da minha vida académica não seria possível sem a ajuda de ... 
First of all I would personally like to thank both my supervisors, professors
Mário Freire and Pedro Inácio, for the opportunity they have given me in the
form of this project. I would also like to thank them for all the support and
guidance they have given me throught this endeavour. I would also want to
mention all my professors throughout my academic path because each and every one
actually thought me something new and expanded my knowledge.

Secondly I would like to reffer all the support of my parents and family,
without whom I wouldn't be the person I am.

Of course a honorable mention will go to Guido van Rossum, creator of the Python
programming language, not just because this project was developed with it but
also because he developed an entire sub-sulture which is based on open-source
and sharing knowledge without which I could achieve the system described in the
report.
