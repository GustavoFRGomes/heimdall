\section{Introdução}
\label{chap2:sec:intro}
Nowadays there has been a number of cases that work reveal the insecurity of
most devices on the Internet of Things
% put some references here maybe!!
but how do regular people protect themselves from the perils their devices
might bring to their household? There isn't a solution to protect their own
network from anyone who could leverage their "smart" appliances to get inside
it and perform malicious actions, like traffic monitoring, sensitive
information extraction or even make your devices part of a botnet.

The focus of this project is on the traffic that willbe sent from devices onto
the Internet, the outgoing traffic because it represents a point of failure.
If the outgoing traffic isn't secure then anyone could study our daily life,
form the information sent from any "smart" appliances an attacker could study
a potential victim and spy on their lives. At this present time there are a
number of cameras that are connected to the Intenret, thus being part of the
Internet of Things, that are reachable by anyone on the Internet and that
could be viewed by anyone who as a minimum skill level for michieves.

\section{Privacy Concerns}
\label{chap2:sec:priv}
% put some of the images from the first presentation of the IP cams.
There has been some worries about the privacy that some of the devices
connected to the Internet might have, e.g. IP cams. These devices are very
limited in terms of computatioinal resources so they don't implement some basic
security features and as a result anyone could access some of those devices
inside the domestic network from around the world.
There are search engines for devices connected to the Internet which can
identify some devices connected to the Internet and that are unsecure to a
point where anyone could access the information hoozing out to the Internet.

With these search engines anyone could find for example a remote surveillance
camera, or IP cam, which is reachable from the Internet and which could be used
to spy on people's lives. Privacy is a concept which has been talked about in
today's world and these cameras and systems are simply making any footage
accessible by anyone online, mostly this is not done by the manufacturers as a
way to let anyone spy on us but rather a negligence based on the lack of power
and resources those machines have, which make it harder if not impossible to
secure them with the computational resources at hand so they don't shield the
users privacy over functionality.
